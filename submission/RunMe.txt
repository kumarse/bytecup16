Two system requirements to run our code:-
1)Code has to be executed in Google Cloud: To get best performance, we implemented multi processing tasks in our code, Thus it doesn't run in single processing machine. 
2)Graphlab has to be installed: We have used graphlab library in our program. 

The files are named by the algorithm name. To run it , you need to pass a parameter [0 or 1]. For 0, it runs for validation set and for 1, it runs for test set.
